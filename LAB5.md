### Part1 - Debugging Scenario

### Part2 - Reflection
From Cse15L Learned about Github, debugging and SSH. GitHub is like this awesome platform our code while working on group projects and create a space called a repository for your project, and it keeps track of all the changes you make, can easily go back to an older version if you break something. Pull requests are like a way to show off your changes to the team before actually putting them into the main code. And when things go wrong, debugging is like detective work. we put these print things in your code to figure out where it's going wrong, use fancy tools to step through your code, and write tests to catch problems early. Oh, and SSH is this security superhero that lets you securely connect to servers and do your thing. It's all about keeping our code safe and making sure it works. It might sound complicated, but once you get the hang of it, it's like having superpowers for coding!
